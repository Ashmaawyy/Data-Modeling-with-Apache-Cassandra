## In this project I answer 3 questions regarding a songs dataset

### Question #1

### Give me the artist, song title and song's length in the music app history that was heard during  a given sessionId, and a specific itemInSession

### Question #2

### Give me only the following: name of artist, song (sorted by itemInSession) and user (first and last name) for a given userid, and a given sessionid

### Question #3

### Give me every user name (first and last) in my music app history who listened to the song 'All Hands Against His Own'
